0,0001487931,FISION Corp,20230103,"An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, along with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, before considering making an investment decision to purchase any of our securities. If one or more of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. In that case, the price of our common shares in any trading market could decline materially, and you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business We have a limited operating history and substantial accumulated losses, and we anticipate incurring continued losses. Our business must be considered and evaluated in light of the risks, expenses, and problems frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development and commercialization of products, and particularly companies like us participating in new and rapidly evolving markets. These risks include our failure to anticipate and adapt to new technology or changing market conditions, our inability to secure enough future material customers to achieve profitability, the rejection of or lack of satisfaction with our services and products by our existing or potential customers, our inability to obtain additional capital when needed from time to time, our inability to protect our intellectual property, and any development of equal or superior products or services by our competitors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will be successful in addressing these risks. We incurred operating losses of (1,230,029) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and net losses of (2,491,533) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Since our inception in 2010, we have an accumulated deficit of (31,474,016) as of December 31, 2021. Moreover, we expect to continue operating at a loss during 2022 and likely even beyond 2022. There is no assurance based on our past business experience to support any belief that we can become profitable or sustain profitability in the future. There can be no assurance that we can generate significant revenue growth, or that any revenue growth that we achieve can be sustained. To any extent that increases in our operating expenses precede or are not soon followed by increased revenues, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected materially. If we are unable to obtain significant future financing from time to time, our development and operations will encounter serious delays or could even result in the complete failure of our business. Our ability to become commercially successful and profitable will depend largely on our being able to continue raising significant additional financing from time to time in the future. If we are unable to raise additional financing through equity and/or debt sources as needed, we would not be able to succeed in our commercial operations, which eventually could result in our failure. There is no assurance any such additional funds will be available on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. We have a significant amount of debt, much of which has matured, and this could limit or even eliminate recovery of your investment if we fail to reach substantial profitability or otherwise resolve or satisfy our outstanding debt. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the form of various Notes Payable. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2.5 Million of outstanding Notes Payable, much of which are now due, or even due on demand. There is no assurance that we will be able to convert our outstanding debt into common stock, or to satisfy this debt through new financing or refinancing, or to achieve profitability sufficient to make future payments to satisfy this debt. If we cannot satisfy or resolve our substantial outstanding indebtedness, such failure would have a significant adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could even cause a total failure of our business. 8 Table of Contents We may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our operating expenses have been funded by various sources including sales of our equity and debt securities, limited revenues from customer contracts, deferral of management salaries, and stock-based payment to management and certain service providers and consultants. Due to this situation and our ongoing substantial losses, there is substantial doubt whether our business can continue as a going concern to support its commercial operations and satisfy its outstanding debt and other obligations. Our management is in the process of attempting to obtain additional significant financing to enable us to continue as a going concern, but there is no assurance that adequate funds will become available to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate future material revenues will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the rate of acceptance of our software products, competitive pressures in our industry, adapting to changes in technology in our industry, and general economic trends. We cannot forecast accurately what our revenues will be in future periods. Our operating results have fluctuated and been difficult to predict, and our results could continue to fluctuate and be unpredictable in the future. Our operating results have been difficult to predict, have historically fluctuated, and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results may include: any material changes in demand for our software solutions; the introduction of new technologies by competitors; the nature of our variable and unpredictable sales cycle; changes in the number, availability and quality of competing products; the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses incurred by us to attract new customers; changes in the economic or business prospects of our customers or the economy generally; changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; changes in governmental regulation of the Internet, wireless networks and mobile platforms; unforeseen costs necessary to improve and maintain our technologies; and costs related to any acquisitions undertaken by us. We face significant challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our products and establishing our Fision brand. Our success depends primarily upon the acceptance of our software platform and our brands by new customers, most of who are not familiar with and have not used our products, and also do not recognize our brand and corporate identity. Acceptance of our software solutions by new customers will depend on many factors including price, reliability, performance, service accessibility and effectiveness, and our ability to overcome existing loyalties to established brands. There is no assurance we will be able to meet these challenges successfully. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and any material reduction in the use of our software platform by our major customers could reduce our revenues significantly. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, two customers and three customers, respectively, each accounted for more than 10 of our revenues. A significant reduction for any reason in the use of our software solutions by one or more of our major customers could harm our business materially. We currently have no fulltime management or key employees, which harms our business substantially. Our future success will depend significantly upon our financial ability to attract and sustain fulltime employment of competent management and other key employees. Our future business will be dependent on hiring additional qualified key personnel, and if they are not available when needed or we cannot obtain sufficient working capital to afford them if available, our future growth and prospects would suffer materially. 9 Table of Contents We operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully. Our market is highly competitive, with many companies providing solutions competitive to our software platform. Well-known and established competitors include Marketo (Adobe), Eloqua (Oracle), Unica (IBM), Hubspot, ExactTarget (Salesforce), Aprimo, Responsys and Silverpop. We expect additional material competitors to emerge in the future from time to time. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly more personnel, financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we possess, and accordingly they are able to devote substantially greater resources than us to development, marketing, sales, and support of their products and services. We lack many things which most of our competitors have, including an established brand and name recognition, existing relationships with a large customer base, the ability to undertake costly and extensive marketing campaigns, and large customer support teams. Software solutions and demands in our industry often change significantly, and our future success will depend materially on our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes. If we cannot adjust, develop and compete effectively with changing software solutions and products as and when they are introduced in our industry, our ability to generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitable operations would be impaired substantially. Our current and potential competitors may develop and offer new software technologies that render our products less competitive, unmarketable or even obsolete. In addition, if any competitors develop products with similar or better functionality than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our products to remain competitive, which could result in a material reduction in our margins and a corresponding material negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to address and solve satisfactorily the many competitive pressures and challenges facing us in our industry, and our failure to do so would harm substantially our business, operating results and financial condition. Our market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could harm our business. Development of marketing software solutions is an emerging market, and our current and future customers may ultimately find our software platform to be less effective than anticipated for promoting their products or services, which as a result could cause them to reduce their spending on our software solutions. Failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business seriously. Any failure by our management or other key personnel to manage any future growth properly could impair our ability to deliver our software solutions in a timely fashion, to fulfill existing customer commitments, or to attract and retain new customers. Interruption or failure of information technology and communications systems used by us could hurt our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. The availability to our customers of our products and services depends on the continuing and efficient operation of information technology and communications systems and infrastructure used by us, and most particularly on the cloud-based service provider facility which hosts our Fision software platform. These electronic systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, vandalism, sabotage, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power outages, telecommunications failures, and computer viruses or other deliberate attempts to harm the systems. The occurrence of a natural or intentional disaster, any decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice, or particularly an unanticipated problem at our cloud-based virtual server facility, could result in harmful interruptions in our service, resulting in damage to our customers and brand. 10 Table of Contents We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property (IP) rights. Our success and competitive position will depend materially on our ability to protect our intellectual property (IP), including trademarks, trade names, patent rights and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect these proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to wrongly obtain and use our information technology. In addition, competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, or they become marginalized or valueless due to developments by a competitor, our business could suffer materially. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. We have obtained certain patents from the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USTPO) covering certain technological aspects of our Fision software platform. We also have filed certain other patent claims with the USTPO and we expect to receive patent protection regarding these other pending patent claims. Although we regard the proprietary software technology covered by our granted and pending patents to be significant for our future business, there is no assurance that any granted or pending patents will provide us with any significant proprietary protection. We could incur substantial costs and disruption to our business as a result of any infringement claim brought against us involving intellectual property of another party, which could harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict whether any third-party claims will occur alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, and if any such claims occur whether they will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend any infringement claims, whether with or without merit or even if determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of our management and other personnel. Moreover, any outcome of a claim resulting in our having infringed another s intellectual property rights may require us to pay significant damages and attorney fees; to cease licensing our Fision software platform; to expend substantial development resources to redesign our products; or to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements to use third-party technologies, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The time and resources required from us to resolve any such disputes or litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our common stock has been downgraded to the OTC Expert Market and a s a practical matter, the Company s stockholders no longer have a public trading market for their shares of common stock. OTC Markets Group has downgraded trading in the Company s common stock to the OTC Expert Market. See Item 5 of this Form 10-K.The Expert Market is available only for unsolicited quotes, meaning broker-dealers may use the Expert Market to publish unsolicited quotes representing limit orders from retail and institutional investors who are not affiliates or insiders of the issuer. Quotations in Expert Market securities are only made available to broker-dealers, institutions and other sophisticated investors.Because of the restrictions imposed on securities quoted on the Expert Market, most investors will not be able to publicly sell their shares. Additionally, they will not have access to bid and ask prices or other information, including trading volume. As such, Expert Market shares are illiquid and, as a practical matter, the Company s stockholders no longer have a public trading market for their shares of common stock. The Company is in the process of submitting the missed that resulted in the downgrade of the Company s common stock to the Expert Market. Upon submission of the missed filings, the Company currently intends to develop a plan, as soon as economically feasible, to return the Company s common stock to the OTC Pink market or other appropriate listing service or exchange. The Company s common stock is expected to continue to be traded on the OTC Expert Market, and the Company is currently considering alternatives that will provide additional trading opportunities in the Company s common stock at the earliest opportunity, including through submission of a Form 211 and application to upgrade to the Pink Current Tier of OTC Markets Group. However, there can be no assurance that such an application will be filed by the Company or approved by OTC Markets Group and the Company s common stock accepted for listing by the OTC Markets Group, or that a market for the Company s shares will develop. The current public trading market for our common stock has fluctuated widely. There is no assurance that the trading market for our common stock will become more stable, or will continue to be sustained. Moreover, there remains a significant risk that our common stock price may fluctuate substantially in the future in response to various factors including the following: Variations in our operating results. Departures or additions of management or other key personnel. Announcements of significant acquisitions or strategic joint ventures. Announcements of significant capital commitments or transactions. Announcements of significant patent or other technological matters. Substantial sales of our common stock in the open market. Any significant litigation matters. Announcements of new product developments. Gain or loss of significant customers. Natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics including the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19). General market conditions or specific political and economic conditions. 11 Table of Contents Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock. Under SEC rules, a penny stock includes any equity security having a market price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain limited exceptions. Regarding any transaction involving a penny stock, these rules require a broker or dealer to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, and also to receive from the person a written consent to the transaction and its terms. The broker or dealer also must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that the person is competent to evaluate the risks of penny stocks. Prior to the transaction, the broker or dealer also must deliver a disclosure schedule containing the rights and remedies available to the person, the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and the receipt of the related signed agreement from the person. Due to these penny-stock rules, brokers and dealers may be less willing to execute transactions in penny stock securities, and this may make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of our common stock, which could affect adversely the market value of our common stock. Because we became a publicly-held company by means of a reverse merger with an inactive public company, it may be difficult for us to attract the attention of brokerage firms and financial analysts. Due to our becoming public through a reverse merger, we currently have very limited relationships or public stock trading history with any brokerage firm, underwriter or financial analyst. Accordingly, there may be little or no incentive for securities analysts of brokerage and other financial firms to provide investment coverage of us or to recommend the purchase of our common stock. Being a public company results in additional expenses and diverts management s attentions. Our business must bear the expenses associated with being a public company including being subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other significant business concerns, which could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Applicable and extensive regulatory requirements, including those of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for the Company to retain or even attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect our business and our future relationships in the investment community. Because of the many and ever increasing rules and regulations governing publicly-held companies, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain those qualified officers and directors necessary for effective management. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly added demanding new rules and regulations and the expansion and strengthening of existing rules and regulations, including required certifications by our principal executive officers. The SEC, FINRA and the stock exchanges also continue to add to or expand their rules frequently. This extensive and ongoing regulatory situation regarding the adoption of new rules and regulations by these various agencies has created a real, or at least perceived, increased personal risk to members of management of public companies, which may deter qualified candidates from accepting roles as directors or officers of our Company. If we are unable to attract and retain future qualified officers and directors as needed, the management of our business and our future ability to obtain a listing of our securities on a national stock exchange could be adversely affected materially. 12 Table of Contents If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud. In that event, investors and the financial community could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which in turn may affect adversely the trading price of our stock, or otherwise harm our financial condition. We must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect any fraud or material weaknesses in our internal controls. Any failure by us to implement the changes necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating results materially and also cause investors and financial analysts to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Even if we resolve effectively any such material weaknesses in our internal controls, this still may not prevent all potential errors, since any control system, regardless of its design, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Ownership and related voting power of our shareholders is concentrated in our affiliates and management. At December 31, 2021, our affiliates and directors own approximately 20 of our common stock (or 28 if they exercised warrants held by them), which concentrated ownership by them could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Any material common stock sales by our insiders or affiliates, for example, could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. This substantial concentration of stock ownership also most likely affords our affiliates and management the ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of all directors, and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other significant corporate transactions. Any person acquiring our common stock most likely will have no effective voice in the management of our company. This ownership concentration also could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company, which could deprive our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any earnings experienced by us will be retained to finance the implementation of our operational business plan. Our Articles of Incorporation allow for our Board of Directors to create and designate new series of our preferred stock without any approval of our shareholders, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of our authorized preferred stock without further common stockholder approval for issuance. Accordingly, our directors could authorize preferred shares, for example, that would grant a preference over common shareholders to our assets upon liquidation, or grant voting power and rights superior to those of common shares, or grant rights to preferred stock to accumulate and receive dividend payments before any dividend or other distribution to common shareholders, or grant special redemption terms and rights prior to any redemption of common shares, or grant rights convertible at favorable terms into common stock. Granting one or more of these or other preference rights to preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders including decreasing the relative voting power of our common stock and causing substantial dilution to our common stockholders. We have no outstanding preferred stock and no present intention to designate or issue any series of our preferred stock. 13 Table of Contents The elimination of monetary liability against our directors and executive officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by them granted by our bylaws may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors and officers. Our articles of incorporation eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to the Company and its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty to the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law. These provisions and resultant costs may discourage us, or our stockholders through derivative litigation, from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for any breaches of their fiduciary duties, even if such legal actions, if successful, might benefit us or our stockholders. In addition, our bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law for costs or damages incurred by them involving legal proceedings brought against them relating to their positions with the Company. These indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers. Delaware law contains anti-takeover provisions which could deter or even prevent acquisition attempts of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of our incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from acquiring us, without the consent of our board of directors, for at least three years from the date they first owned at least 15 of our common stock. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics (including the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic) and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain certain limited disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services.",Not applicable. 14 Table of Contents,"Our principal telephone and other administrative office functions are currently being outsourced to an independent contractor in Minneapolis, Minnesota providing such virtual office services to various business entities, and located at 1650 West End Boulevard, Suite 100, Minneapolis, MN 55416. For these administrative office services, we pay a monthly fee of 322 which includes a storage fee for certain computer servers and other technology equipment and supplies owned by us. We do not own any real estate. We believe that such current outsourced office facilities and services are adequate to satisfy our current office and administrative operations.","In late 2018 the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Continuity Logic, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited liability company (the Continuity Logic Merger to effect a merger which would have resulted in our shareholders as a group and the equity holders of Continuity Logic as a group each owning 50 of the post-merger combined companies. A key provision of this Continuity Logic Merger provided that the parties and their representatives were required to raise enough working capital to support the post-merger funding requirements of the combined companies, and also that the merger be completed by December 31, 2018. Accordingly, in February 2019 Continuity Logic terminated this merger since it was not consummated by December 31, 2018. The Company no longer has any relationship or involvement with the business or future prospects of Continuity Logic. While the Continuity Logic Merger was pending, the Company made various bridge loans to Continuity Logic for working capital, of which a total balance of 905,500 has been long overdue and is still outstanding. These loans matured on August 31, 2019, bear interest at 6 per annum, and a substantial portion of the Notes is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest on the accounts receivable of Continuity Logic. The termination of the Continuity Logic Merger did not change or affect the continuing obligation of Continuity Logic to satisfy the payment of these loans to the Company. The Company took a reserve as of December 31, 2019 of the entire 905,500 plus accrued interest against the balance of these notes receivables. Under a court approved settlement agreement dated June 28, 2021, which Continuity Logic LLC has satisfied its obligations within the time periods specified in the settlement agreement and made payments totaling 567,993 for the year ended December 31, 2021, all of which was received in the third quarter. The Company recorded a gain on this settlement of 567,993 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Continuity Logic LLC was also required to pay the balance of the Company s unsecured claim plus additional accrued interested by April 30, 2022. Continuity Logic LLC satisfied all the required obligations of the settlement agreement by making payments totaling 431,040 in the second quarter of 2022. Subsequently, both companies entered into a mutual release. During the period, we settled and satisfied the complaint against us in a Minnesota District Court regarding our debt to Decathlon Alpha L.P. We used 60,000 of these Continuity Logic LLC settlement proceeds to make an initial payment on a this settled complaint with Decathlon Alpha L.P., with a final payment of 117,500 paid on September 15, 2022.",Not applicable. 15 Table of Contents PART II,"Market Information Our common stock has historically been publicly traded in the over-the-counter market, and has been quoted and traded for years on either the OTCQB Tier or the Pink Current Tier of OTC Markets Group under the symbol FSSN . Our common stock is thinly traded, and there is no assurance that our common stock will trade more actively in the future. On July 20, 2022, the Company was notified by OTC Markets Group that trading in the Company s common stock would be downgraded to the OTC Expert Market because the Company s disclosures were not current and publicly available under SEC Rule 15c2-11 as a result of the Company s delinquent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022. In essence, Rule 15c2-11 prohibits dealers from publishing quotations for OTC securities to quotation mediums without first reviewing certain issuer financial information and ensuring that information is current and publicly available before quoting that security. Accordingly, the Company s common stock was downgraded to the Expert Market effective with the open of business on July 21, 2022. Since that date, the Company s common stock has been eligible for trading on the OTC Expert Market. The Expert Market is available only for unsolicited quotes, meaning broker-dealers may use the Expert Market to publish unsolicited quotes representing limit orders from retail and institutional investors who are not affiliates or insiders of the issuer. Quotations in Expert Market securities are only made available to broker-dealers, institutions and other sophisticated investors. Because of the restrictions imposed on securities quoted on the Expert Market, most investors will not be able to publicly sell their shares. Additionally, they will not have access to bid and ask prices or other information, including trading volume. As such, Expert Market shares are illiquid and, as a practical matter, the Company s stockholders no longer have a public trading market for their shares of common stock. A company relegated to the Expert Market will be able to reapply for listing on the OTC Markets through the filing of a new Form 211 with FINRA once the Company has made current information available and is in compliance with Rule 15c2-11. Prior to the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company was not current with its SEC reporting obligations with respect to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 (the Missed Annual Report ), and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ending March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 (the Missed Quarterly Reports, and together with the Missed Annual Report, the Missed Filings ). The Company is in the process of satisfying the required reporting requirements. This Form 10-K represents the Missed Annual Report, and the Company currently expects to file the Missed Quarterly Reports by January 31, 2023. The submission of those filings will complete the process of preparing the Missed Filings that resulted in the downgrade of the Company s common stock to the Expert Market. Upon submission of the Missed Filings, the Company currently intends to develop a plan, as soon as economically feasible, to return the Company s common stock to the OTC Pink market or other appropriate listing service or exchange. The Company s common stock is expected to continue to be traded on the OTC Expert Market, and the Company is currently considering alternatives that will provide additional trading opportunities in the Company s common stock at the earliest opportunity, including through submission of a Form 211 and application to upgrade to the Pink Current Tier of OTC Markets Group. However, there can be no assurance that such an application will be filed by the Company or approved by OTC Markets Group and the Company s common stock accepted for listing by the OTC Markets Group, or that a market for the Company s shares will develop. Since January 1, 2020, the high and low sale prices per share for our common stock as reported by OTC Markets Group are shown below, which quotations do not reflect retail mark-up, markdown or commission: High Low Price Price January March, 2020 0.0166 0.0021 April June, 2020 0.006 0.0021 July September, 2020 0.0186 0.0036 October December, 2020 0.033 0.005 January March, 2021 0.040 0.019 April June, 2021 0.088 0.023 July September, 2021 0.037 0.020 October December, 2021 0.033 0.017 January March, 2022 0.024 0.010 April June 2022 0.017 0.005 July September 2022 0.0111 0.0002 October December 22, 2022 0.001 0.0009 The last sale price of our common stock as reported by OTC Markets Group on December 22, 2022 was 0.001 per share. Stockholders As of December 22, 2022, there were 560 holders of record of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any future earnings for the development and growth of our business. Any future payment of dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, and investment or acquisition opportunities. Description of Securities Common Stock Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value .0001 per share, and as of December 22, 2022, there were 462,878,589 shares of our common stock outstanding. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for dividends. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all our assets legally available for distribution after payment of all our debts and liabilities and liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights, and they have no rights for cumulative voting regarding any election of directors. 16 Table of Contents Preferred Stock The Company is also authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value .0001 per share. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue these preferred shares in one or more designated series, to establish the number of shares in each series, and to fix the preferences, powers, dividends, and voting or conversion rights of any preferred shares, which could dilute the voting power or other rights of holders of our common stock. We have no outstanding preferred stock, and we have no current plans to designate terms of or issue any preferred stock. Transfer Agent Our transfer agent is Globex Transfer, LLC, 780 Deltona Blvd., Suite 202, Deltona, FL 32725, phone number (813) 344-4490. Our transfer agent is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any person (or persons who are aggregated) including persons who are affiliates, whose restricted common stock has been fully paid for and held for at least six months from the later of the date acquired from us or from an affiliate of us, may sell such common stock in broker s transactions or directly to market makers, provided the number of shares sold in any three-month period may not exceed one percent of our then outstanding shares of common stock. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to certain notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us. After one year has elapsed since the date of purchase or other acquisition of such common shares from us or an affiliate of us, persons who are not affiliates of us may sell their shares under Rule 144 without any limitation. Future sales of our common stock under Rule 144 or otherwise could negatively impact the price of our common stock in any public market where it is traded. We cannot estimate the number of shares that may be sold in the future by our existing shareholders or the effect, if any, that sales of shares by our stockholders will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time.

None.",Not applicable,". The financial data referred to in the following discussion and analysis is derived from our audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which are included in this Annual Report. These financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The following discussion and analysis of our financial data is only a summary and you should read and consider it in conjunction with our financial statements and their related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are an Internet platform technology company providing cloud-based software solutions to automate the marketing functions and activities of our customers and to provide credit repair tools to credit repair businesses. Our business is conducted through: iii. our Minnesota Fision subsidiary based in Minneapolis, which since 2011 has created and offered software solutions to support marketing and sales enablement activities of both private businesses and public companies; iv. our Scoreinc.com subsidiary based in Puerto Rico, which was acquired on May 30, 2021 and provides software solutions including credit repair tools, strategies and services to credit repair businesses. Under ASC SoftDev LLC, we are using certain attributes of the two existing software platforms of the Company to assist in building and creating a new software platform to assist the efficiencies of the ASC ambulatory surgery center operations. Under Fort Myers ASC LLC, we are in the final stages of approval for the development and renovation for a four operating room orthopedic surgery center under the operating name Total Joint Orthopedic Surgery Center in Fort Myers, Florida. Revenue Model Our revenue model is primarily based on prescribed software licensing fees received by us on a regular monthly basis from customers which are under written licensing agreements with us. Because of the long-term nature and the substantial expense commitment required by each new customer to enter into a binding licensing agreement with us, the sales cycle involved in our revenue model is quite lengthy. Accordingly, the unpredictable and different timing involved from customer to customer to procure our licensing contracts has prevented us from receiving consistent overall revenues or accurately forecasting our future revenue stream. 18 Table of Contents We generate our revenues primarily from recurring monthly payments from customers having a license from one to three years to access and use our proprietary marketing software platform, which payments include fees based on actual use of the Fision platform. We also receive from each new customer a prescribed one-time set-up and integration fee payable to us at the outset of the license. And we receive certain secondary fees from time to time for customized software development projects, and for processing emails for certain customers. Marketing Model We have marketed and licensed our proprietary software products primarily through direct sales by our management and other in-house personnel, and also secondarily through experienced and recognized independent sales agencies. We generate our revenues primarily from such software licensing contracts, and we currently have six (6) licensed customers using our Fision platform. We market and sell our products and services in the marketing software segment of the broader software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. Intellectual Property (IP) In 2017, we were granted Patent No. US 9,639,551 B2 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and in 2018 we were granted Patent No. US 9,984,094 B2 from the USPTO, and another granted Patent in 2019 Patent No. US 10,235,380 B2, from the USPTO which were titled Computerized Sharing of Digital Asset Localization Between Organizations. We also have an additional patent claim involving our software technology filed and pending with the USPTO. Inflation and Seasonality We do not consider our operations and business to be materially affected by either inflation or seasonality. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation Regarding our wholly-owned subsidiaries, our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis with all intercompany transactions and balances eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. Such estimates include management s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, derivative securities, fair value of financial instruments, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. 19 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable related to the products and services sold are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are presented on the balance sheet net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The ultimate collection of the receivable may not be known for several months after services have been provided and billed. We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, analyses of current and historical cash collections, and the aging of receivables. Delinquent accounts are written-off when the likelihood for collection is remote and/or when we believe collection efforts have been fully exhausted and we do not intend to devote any additional efforts in an attempt to collect the receivable. We adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts balance on a quarterly basis. Product Development and Support We expense all our product development and support operations and activities as they occur. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 we incurred total expenses of 452,493 for such development and support. In comparison, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 we incurred total expenses of 340,232 for product development and support. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are capitalized and stated at cost, and any additions, renewals or betterments are also capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred. If property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method with estimated lives as follows: Furniture and fixtures 5 years Computer and office equipment 5 years Derivative Securities We evaluate all of our agreements and financial instruments to determine if they contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For any derivative financial instruments accounted for as liabilities, they initially will be accounted for at fair value and if necessary re-valued at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value reported in our statements of operations. For any stock-based derivative financial instruments or securities, we use an option pricing model to value them at inception and on any subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether they should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in our balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Fair Value of Financial Instruments FASB ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of and defines fair value of financial instruments, and also establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for these disclosures. The carrying amounts reported in a balance sheet for receivables and current liabilities qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between their origination and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy for fair value determinations are defined as follows: Level 1 inputs include quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs include observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Level 3 inputs include one or more unobservable inputs which we have assessed and assumed that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 20 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided over the contract period, normally one (1) to three (3) years. We invoice one-time startup and implementation costs, such as consolidating and uploading digital assets of the customer, upon completion of those services as one performance obligation and recorded as revenue when completed. Monthly services, such as internet access to software as a service (SaaS), hosting and weekly backups are invoiced monthly as another performance obligation and recorded as revenue over time. Company Recognizes Contract Liability for Its Performance Obligation -- Upon receipt of a prepayment from a customer, the Company recognizes acontract liability in the amount of the prepayment for its performance obligation to transfer goods and services in the future. When the Company transfers those goods and services and, therefore, satisfies its performance obligation to the customer, the Company will then recognize the revenue. Stock-Based Compensation We record stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 718, which requires us to measure the cost for any stock-based employee compensation at fair value and recognize the expense over the related service period. We recognize the fair value of stock options, warrants, and any other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees as of the grant date. We use the Black Scholes model to measure the fair value of options and warrants. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby any deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and any deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of our management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 21 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. In determining if an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260, which provides that basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares, options, and warrants were exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method, which provides that options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if the funds obtained thereby are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the AICPA, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements. Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Revenue Revenue was 620,496 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to revenue of 361,888 for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2020, an increase of 258,608, or 71 , was due primarily to the Company s acquisition of Score in 2021. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in fiscal year 2021 was 157,991 (25.5 of revenue) compared to cost of sales in fiscal year 2020 of 87,361 (24.1 of revenue), which increase was due primarily due to internal hosting of the Score platform. Gross Margin Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was 462,505 compared to 274,527 for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 187,978 attributableprimarily to the addition of Score revenue in 2021. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74.5 for fiscal year 2021 compared to 75.9 for fiscal year 2020. Operating Expenses Operating expenses totaled 1,692,534 for fiscal year 2021 compared to 1,467,531 for fiscal year 2020, which comparable operating expenses included: (i) Sales and marketing expenses of 23,938 in 2021 compared to 5,474 in 2020, which large increase of 18,463 in 2021 was due primarily to costs related to the Score acquisition; (ii) Research and development expenses of 452,493 in 2021 compared to 340,232 in 2020, which increased due to development costs of our surgery center business; and (iii) General and administrative expenses of 1,216,103 in 2021 compared to 1,121,825 in 2020, which increased due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets. 22 Table of Contents Operating loss Operating loss was (1,230,029) in 2021 compared to (1,193,004) in 2020. This decrease in the loss was primarily due to the increase in revenue offset by increases in sales and marketing and development expenses. Other Income (Expenses) Other Income (Expenses) for fiscal year 2021 were 4,059,338, including, debt settlement income of 1,439,079, change in fair value of derivatives of 2,806,495, gain on settlement of notes receivable of 555,928, and other items totaling 209,044. These incomes were offset by loan interest of (263,119), loss on change in fair value of Scoreinc.com contingent liability of (75,698), and amortization of debtdiscount of (612,391). In comparison, Other Income (Expenses) for fiscal year 2020 were (1,298,529), including loan interest of (738,443), debtamortization and discount expenses of (318,694), debt settlement and bad debt expenses of (88,740), change in fair value of derivatives of (195,682) and miscellaneous debt expense of (5,228), offset by Other Income of 48,258. The large difference between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 in our Other Income (Expenses) was due primarily to non-cash accounting adjustments related to accounting for our convertible debt and various settlements in the Company s favor. Net Income (Loss) Our net income for fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was 2,829,309 compared to a net (loss) of (2,491,533) for fiscal year ended December31, 2020. This favorable change of 5,320,842 in fiscal 2021 was due primarily to the various changes and Other Income (Expenses) above described. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial condition and future prospects critically depend on our access to financing in order to continue funding our operations. Much of our cost structure is based on costs related to personnel and facilities and is not subject to significant variability. In order to fund our operations and working capital needs, we have historically utilized loans from accredited investors (including management), sales of our common stock and convertible debt securities to accredited investors, and issuances of common stock to satisfy outstanding debt and to pay for development, marketing, management, financial, professional and other services. In order to attain material growth of our SaaS Fision and ScoreCEO platforms and progress with our surgery center project, we will need to raise substantial additional capital through private or public offerings of equity or debt securities, or a combination thereof, and we may have to use a material portion of the capital raised to repay past due debt obligations. To the extent any capital raised is insufficient to satisfy operational working capital needs and meet any required debt payments, we will need to either extend, refinance or convert to equity our past due indebtedness, which there is no assurance we can accomplish. At December 31, 2021 the Company had notes payable indebtedness totaling 2,400,846 including related party accrued interest and debt discounts. Certain information on our notes payable is set forth in Note 8 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. In order to fund and conduct our business over the past few years, we relied significantly on working capital obtained from private sales of our equity and convertible debt securities to various accredited investors. Due primarily to our continued substantial operating losses for the past several years, we recently have been unable to continue raising such working capital as needed to support adequately our business plan for future growth. And unless we are able to raise needed substantial additional funding to achieve significant future revenue growth, our current business model most likely will not succeed. The board is exploring raising more working capital through the issuance of common and preferred stock. We have engaged an investment banking firm that specializes in health care to advise on the appropriate structure and to assist raising capital. 23 Table of Contents We may not be able to sell sufficient securities or otherwise obtain such financing when needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If further financing is not available, we may be forced to abandon certain business plans or even our entire business. Moreover, regarding any financing we may obtain, any equity or convertible debt financing would be dilutive to our shareholders, and any available debt financing may involve restrictive covenants. Liquidity represents the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to provide for its immediate needs for cash, which our continued losses have made it difficult for us to satisfy. As of December 31, 2021, we had 478,615 of cash and receivables, and a working capital deficiency of (1,970,604). Over the past few years we have continued to incur substantial losses without any material increase in liquid assets, which has caused a serious and harmful effect to our liquidity and a substantial strain on our ongoing business operations. Along with our limited revenues, we have financed our operations to date through (i) loans from management and from financial and other lenders, including convertible debt (ii) stock-based compensation issued to employees and for consulting, outsourced software, and professional services, (iii) common stock issued to satisfy outstanding loans and accounts payable/accrued expenses, and (iv) equity sales of our common stock. Net Cash Used In Operating Activities We used 944,856 of net cash in operating activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021compared to 229,571 of net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used for operating activities was due primarily increased sales and marketing costs and development and support costs. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities During fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, we spent 126,765 in construction costs for our surgery center project and collected 567,993 on the Continuity Logic receivable. We used no cash flows from investing activities in 2020. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities During fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we were provided by financing activities with net cashof 866,110 including proceeds from sales of common stock of 216,110 and issuance of convertible notes payable of 780,271, offset by the repayment of notes payable of 104,771 and repayments of related party notes payable of 25,500. In comparison, during fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we were provided by financing activities with net cashof 222,565 including proceeds from sales of common stock of 50,000, proceeds from an SBA-PPP loan of 177,200, and proceeds from a Note Payable of 78,000, offset by repayments on Notes Payable and a line of credit totaling of 82,635. Convertible Note Financing For the past few years, a majority of our financing has consisted of convertible notes sold to accredited investors in private transactions. In 2021 and 2020, we raised 780,271 and 78,000, respectively, through issuance of convertible notes. Our 2018-2019 Private Placement of Securities In October 2018 we commenced a private offering of 2,000,000 of our common stock at .20 per share (10,000,000 shares), offered only to accredited investors. All private investors in this placement also received additional Advisory Shares, Warrants and potential True-Up and Penalty Shares as follows: Advisory Shares Each investor also received an amount of Advisory Shares equal to 10 of the common shares purchased by the investor at .20 per share. Warrants Each private investor also received three-year warrants to purchase additional common shares equal to their purchased shares at an exercise price of .20 per share. True-Up and Penalty Shares Each private investor also received the right to receive True-Up shares in the event the True-Up Price as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement for this placement is lower than the .20 price for the purchased shares. The True-Up Price represents the average of the fifteen lowest public market closing prices during a specified 90-day period and having a floor of .10 per share. Based on trading of our common stock, the calculated True-Up Price per share relating to such a 15-day average became lower than this .10 floor. 24 Table of Contents In addition, the warrants issued to investors in this private offering are subject to the same True-Up Price adjustment regarding their exercise price. In 2019, we sold 8,750,000 common shares offered in this private placement and received total proceeds of 1,750,000 from investors, for which we issued an aggregate of 8,750,000 purchased shares and 875,000 Advisory Shares. In 2020, we issued an additional total of 9,625,000 common shares to investors in this private offering for required true-up and penalty shares. Going Concern As stated in the audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates and implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred operating losses of (1,230,029) and (1,193,004), respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of (31,474,016) and a working capital deficiency of (1,970,604) as of December 31, 2021. We are continuing to incur material losses in 2022. These adverse financial conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet items as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.",. Not applicable.,. See our financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report.,. None.,"Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their desired objectives. Our management will apply its best judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of any disclosure controls and procedures adopted by us. 25 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The design of our disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that we will face personnel and financial restraints for some time, and accordingly the benefit of such controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting is being designed to include policies and procedures that are intended to: (i) maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management applied the integrated framework and criteria which has been developed and set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (revised 2013). This assessment included an evaluation of the design and procedures of our control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2021 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to certain material weaknesses. These identified material weaknesses included (i) an insufficient accounting staff; and (ii) limited checks and balances in processing cash and other transactions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",None. 26 Table of Contents PART III,".

Employment Agreements With Our Executive Officers We currently have no outstanding employment agreements with any executive officers.

The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and our stockholders by attracting, retaining and rewarding our employees and key consultants performing services for us, and to motivate them to contribute to our growth and profitability. Issuance of Awards. Under the Plan, the issuance of awards and the persons, terms and conditions regarding any award are determined by our Board of Directors.

Term and Vesting of Options. Incident to granting an option award, the Board of Directors must fix the term, exercise price, number of optionshares, and any applicable vesting conditions or schedule. The Board of Directors retains the right to accelerate vesting of an option anytime for any reason. The maximum term of an option under the Plan is ten years. Exercise Price and Manner of Exercise.

Transferability of Awards. Grants of options under the Plan are not transferable other than by will or laws of descent and can only be exercised bythe grantee during his or her lifetime. Immediate Acceleration. The Plan provides that all options and awards not yet vested will be fully vested, and all performance conditions forrestricted stock or performance share awards shall be deemed satisfied, in the event of (i) a change of control whereby a person or related group obtains 40 or more of our common stock, or (ii) a majority of our directors is replaced within 24 months without approval of the existing Board of Directors, or (iii) our stockholders approve a merger or the sale or other disposition of substantially all our assets.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph- Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had an operating loss of 1,230,029, accumulated deficit of 31,474,016, net cash used in operating activities of 944,856, and had negative working capital of 1,970,604. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. F-1 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Intangible Assets in the Score, Inc. Acquisition As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Score, Inc. (Score) for consideration of 789,370 and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The acquired intangible assets included developed technology, permits, website, partner agreement, customer relationship, trade name and customer relationships valued at a total of approximately 663,000. In addition goodwill of approximately 174,000 was recorded. The Company recorded the acquired intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition using a discounted cash flow methodology to developed technology and trade name and a cost approach to permits, website and partner agreement. The methods used to estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets involve significant assumptions. The significant assumptions applied by management in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets included income projections and discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of intangible assets in the Score acquisition is a critical audit matter are (1) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value of intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimates and (2) significant audit effort was required in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, including the income projections and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, reading the memorandum of understanding, and testing management s process for estimating the fair value of intangible assets. Testing management s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models, and testing the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including the income projections and discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the income projections involved considering the current performance of the acquired business, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with other evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including the discount rates, by comparing them against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies.
